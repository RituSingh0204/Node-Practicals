It ensures the installation is clean and reproducible using a deterministic package-lock.json.

 What It Does

Creates an isolated sandbox directory

Installs a specific version of any npm package

Generates a lockfile for version control

Verifies the installed dependency tree checksum

 How to Run

Open the Practical 8 folder in VS Code.

Run the following command:

node main.js


The script will create the sandbox, install the package, and log results in the console.
